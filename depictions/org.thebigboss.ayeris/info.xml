			ayeris, finally ported for Anemone!<br/> 
Winterboard is buggy, slow and really outdated, maybe Surenix doesn't know that (?), so we decided to port this theme to the newest and powerful theming engine called Anemone, @coolstarorg (main dev of Anemone) already did a "porting" of Ayeris but he said that he'll never update that "dirty hack" (as he said), so we did!<br/> 
Now applying ayeris is more fast because we used IconBundles-large method built-in in Anemone, and you'll never notice the ⚠️ warning near the theme name in anemone because we fixed the control file of the theme to add Anemome as dependency.<br/>
If you notice bugs or stuff that doesn't work contact our team from Cydia by tapping Author>Maintainer from the theme info page.<br/> 
<br/> 
<b>KNOWN BUGS</b>: Dock has an extra line at the upper side, we'r looking into it.<br/> 
<br/> 
Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Credits:</description></b><br/>
@Geek_Break and @Sn0wCooder for porting the theme, @DeloExtra for some help with the Calendar icon.
